\begin{abstract}

We introduce an automatic approach for optimizing the triangle rendering order of animated
meshes with the objective of reducing overdraw while maintaining good post-transform vertex
cache efficiency. Our approach is based on prior methods designed for static meshes. We propose
an algorithm that clusters the space of viewpoints and key frames. For each
cluster, we generate a triangle order that exhibits satisfactory vertex cache efficiency and low overdraw. Results 
show that our approach significantly improves overdraw throughout the entire animation sequence while only 
requiring a few index buffers. We expect that this approach will be useful for games and other real-time
rendering applications that involve complex shading of articulated characters.
