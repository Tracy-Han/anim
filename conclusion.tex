\section{Conclusion}

We introduced a new algorithm to efficiently reorder triangles
of animated models in order to reduce overdraw. To our knowledge,
this is the first technique that generates such optimized triangle orders for
animations. By using a small number of index buffers, the proposed 
approach produces triangle orders that have significantly
 lower overdraw even when compared 
to techniques that are optimized for static meshes. We presented results
that balance between vertex cache and overdraw performance
as well as results that are solely optimized for reduced overdraw. The approach
is very general and widely applicable to arbitrary animations
in a variety of real-time rendering applications.
